## Test Execution

### Quick Validation (1-2 minutes)
```bash
make test-phase2-quick
```

### Comprehensive Testing (10-15 minutes)
```bash
make test-phase2-full
```

### Performance Benchmarking (20-30 minutes)  
```bash
make test-phase2-performance
```

### Production Readiness (45-60 minutes)
```bash
make test-phase2-production
```

### Individual Component Testing
```bash
make test-phase2-smart-router      # Smart Router tests
make test-phase2-three-tier        # Three-Tier Storage tests  
make test-phase2-incremental       # Incremental Pipeline tests
make test-phase2-enhanced-mcp      # Enhanced MCP Tools tests
make test-phase2-load              # Load testing scenarios
```

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Framework Integration
- Builds upon existing `tests/framework/` infrastructure
- Extends `tests/integration/scip/` test patterns
- Integrates with `tests/performance/` benchmarking

### Synthetic Test Projects
- Multi-language test projects for comprehensive validation
- Realistic dependency graphs and cross-references
- Generated SCIP indices for controlled testing

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection during test execution
- Automated performance regression detection
- Historical performance trend analysis

## CI/CD Integration

### Automated Testing
- Phase 2 tests integrated into existing CI pipeline
- Performance regression detection with automatic alerts
- Production readiness validation before deployment

### Test Reporting
- Comprehensive test reports with performance metrics
- Visual performance dashboards and trend analysis
- Automated notification of performance target violations

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures
- Comprehensive test data covering all Phase 2 scenarios
- Mock SCIP indices for predictable testing
- Multi-language project structures

### Performance Baselines
- Established performance baselines for regression testing
- Target achievement tracking and historical comparison
- Automated baseline updates for continuous improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **High test execution time**: Use `make test-phase2-quick` for development
- **Performance target failures**: Check system resources and concurrent processes
- **Cache hit rate below target**: Verify test data and cache warming procedures

### Debug Mode
```bash
SCIP_DEBUG=1 make test-phase2-full
```

### Performance Profiling
```bash
SCIP_PROFILE=1 make test-phase2-performance
```
